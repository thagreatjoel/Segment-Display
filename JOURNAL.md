## 10/18/2025 7 PM - Routing and Alignments  

Today was all about working on my big 7-segment display project, and honestly, it was a little intense but fun. I'm trying to make a giant vertical display with 8 modules, and each module has a number of points. At first, I felt a little overwhelmed by all the pins and sections, but once I broke it down step by step, it started to make sense.

## 10/18/2025 10 PM - Display Connection Setup  

 I finally reached the wiring stage for my 4digit display, and things are starting to feel more real now.after replacing the previous individual 7-segment units with the new SEG-THx4 module, I noticed that it had pins labeled G1 G2 G3 G4 but no VCC. After some research I found out that it doesn't require vcc at all..![Segment Display (1)_page-0001~2.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2863cc77bb5fcbbe366ad4974a45bba6f83e135c/Segment%20Display%20(1)_page-0001~2.jpg)

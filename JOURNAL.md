## 10/18/2025 7 PM - Routing and Alignments  

Today was all about working on my big 7-segment display project, and honestly, it was a little intense but fun. I'm trying to make a giant vertical display with 8 modules, and each module has a number of points. At first, I felt a little overwhelmed by all the pins and sections, but once I broke it down step by step, it started to make sense.

## 10/18/2025 10 PM - Display Connection Setup  

 I finally reached the wiring stage for my 4digit display, and things are starting to feel more real now.after replacing the previous individual 7-segment units with the new SEG-THx4 module, I noticed that it had pins labeled G1 G2 G3 G4 but no VCC. After some research I found out that it doesn't require vcc at all..![Segment Display (1)_page-0001~2.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzAxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2863cc77bb5fcbbe366ad4974a45bba6f83e135c/Segment%20Display%20(1)_page-0001~2.jpg)
  

## 10/19/2025 6 PM - Order Correction   

At first all was going well then suddenly I found out that each display should have its own max module.. earlier I connected those display 8 - display in one module.. and that was the mistake. I had to change all the things I had done earlier. After going though straight work I finally corrected and had some progress..![Segment Display (2)_page-0001~2.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM1MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--091543e78b21de11bfbf6c84771a5b944d4734eb/Segment%20Display%20(2)_page-0001~2.jpg)
  

## 10/19/2025 10 PM - Addition of more Displays  

I recently added 16 more Displays and had layout. every single displays has its own module. Now there are 4 rows and 8 columes of display.. I connect the DIN pin of MAX1 module to DOUT pin of MAX2 and continued the rest till the 32th module.. it is now all controlled by one ESP32 C3 wroom..![Segment Display_page-0001~3.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c77b883760144ace7f112ada24a037ecd2d5d62d/Segment%20Display_page-0001~3.jpg)
  

## 10/20/2025 11 AM - Addition of Power Supply  

Im pretty sure that I'm cooking well.. right now I don't even understand what I just made.. like, look it yourself. So many wire and stuff. I spent like half n hour only to find the mistake.(Ngl Found few mistake) I also added the C-Type with the regulator for the power ![Segment Display (1)_page-0001 (1)~3.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzY4NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d6401beee7d9762b806b1e10b43c1d9e69799837/Segment%20Display%20(1)_page-0001%20(1)~3.jpg)

## 10/20/2025 8 PM - Designing PCB  

And finally I finished the schematic design... Ahm.. that was rough now next is to design the pcb.. and it is the hardest thing in this project.. like there are 32 display with modules and other components each.. this project will be the longest and toughest thing I'll ever made.. to note that the order of display are all mixed..![PCB_PCB_Segment-Display_2025-10-20 (2)~2.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzcyNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7261aee32034db3a95297e6a6ff33897de17bd89/PCB_PCB_Segment-Display_2025-10-20%20(2)~2.jpg)
